# Steganography
This project implements Steganography â€” the technique of hiding secret information inside images. It allows users to encode (hide) and decode (retrieve) messages within image files using C language

ðŸš€ Features
Hide a secret text message inside an image (PNG/JPEG)
Extract the hidden message from the stego-image
Supports basic encryption (optional)
CLI and/or GUI interface (mention what your project supports)
Easy-to-use and open source

ðŸ“¸ How It Works
The message is converted into binary format.
It is embedded into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image pixels.
The resulting image appears visually unchanged but holds the hidden message.
